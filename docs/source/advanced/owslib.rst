OWSLib
=======


`OWSLib <https://geopython.github.io/OWSLib/>`_ is a Python library for client programming
with Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) web service (hence OWS), like WMS, CSW and WPS.

We are using an Jupyter notebook to look at some example code.

.. todo::
  Add ssh tunnel or jupyter console example.

We need to install `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_ via conda:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda install -c conda-forge jupyter

Go to the tutorials folder ``pywps_clients``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ~/birdhouse-workshop/tutorials/31_owslib

You will find there an Jupyter notebook:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ls
    owslib-wps.ipynb

Open the Jupyter notebook:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ jupyter notebook

And point your browser to the following URL:

http://localhost:8888/notebooks/owslib-wps.ipynb

Or see it on
`GitHub <https://github.com/bird-house/birdhouse-workshop/blob/master/tutorials/31_owslib/owslib-wps.ipynb>`_.
