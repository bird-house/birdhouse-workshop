Web based services could help researchers collaborate
-----------------------------------------------------

The fact that individual researchers are increasingly specialized
raises the “cost” of interacting with other disciplines.

Due to these costs, multidisciplinary projects are often run in parallel,
with no real dependencies and synergies between teams.

Open source code has helped tremendously, but there is a large resource gap
between installing software and having a working application,
especially in earth system modeling.

Why would individual scientists publish services?
-------------------------------------------------

Increased visibility and funding opportunities.

Improved research quality.

Participate to intercomparison projects.
