It works on most common platforms like Linux, macOS and Windows.
If you don't have Conda yet ... we will install it at the beginning of this workshop.

  You will need a text-editor to edit Python code. Choose your favorite one ...
  if you don't have one yet, you can try  `Atom <https://atom.io/>`_
